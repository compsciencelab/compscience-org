title: Computational Science Laboratory
description: Computation applied to Science
introduction: >-
  Our research interests are rooted in the application of computation
  to solve real world problems, based on the view that computation and
  intelligence are very much the same thing. Specifically, we develop new
  methods, programs and algorithms that we apply to areas such as AI, drug
  design, and protein folding. The group and its spin-off company Acellera has collaborated
  with major industries worldwide like Sony, Nvidia, HTC mobile, UCB, Pfizer,
  Biogen, Novartis, etc.

  research_lines:
    left_title: Biomedicine
    left_text: We use computations, as physics-based simulations and machine learning to provide novel, innovative approaches in biomedicine
    right_title: Machine Intelligence
    right_text: We develop machine learning models with the aim to attain in specific environments intelligent, useful behavior using reinforcement learning and deep learning

    left_text:
      - link: HTMD
        url: https://www.htmd.org/
        text: is a Python platform for computational biology, including molecular simulations, docking, Markov state models, molecule manipulation, build tools for Amber and Charmm, visualization (webGL and VMD), adaptive sampling and more. Imagine setting up an entire computational experiment in a single, simple Python script.
      - link: ACEMD
        url: https://www.acellera.com/acemd
        text: has pioneered the use of GPUs for molecular simulations allowing for high-throughput simulations and ultimately leading to HTMD. ACEMD is still one of top molecular dynamics code, simple to use with a NAMD like syntax and compatible with input files from Charmm and Amber.
