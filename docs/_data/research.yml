    - link: HTMD
      url: https://www.htmd.org/
      text: is a Python platform for computational biology, including molecular simulations, docking, Markov state models, molecule manipulation, build tools for Amber and Charmm, visualization (webGL and VMD), adaptive sampling and more. Imagine setting up an entire computational experiment in a single, simple Python script.
    - link: ACEMD/OpenMM
      url: https://www.acellera.com/acemd
      text: has pioneered the use of GPUs for molecular simulations allowing for high-throughput simulations and ultimately leading to HTMD. ACEMD is still one of fastest molecular dynamics code and compatible with input files from Charmm and Amber. ACEMD is now based on OpenMM.
      link: PyTorchRL
      url: https://github.com/PyTorchRL/pytorchrl
      text: is a scalable and modular reinforcement learning framework in PyTorch. Use it simply write new algorithms and scale them up for real performance.
