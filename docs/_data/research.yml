  left_title: Computer Simulations
  left_text: Physics-based simulations and modern machine learning methods provide innovative methodological approaches in biomedicine which can be applied to drug design, protein folding, protein-protein interactions, etc. We created GPUGRID.net, the second largest distributed computing project harnessing several thousands GPUs. We are core project leaders of OpenMM/ACEMD, one of the leading molecular dynamics packages. We created PlayMolecule, a publicly-available platform offering molecular simulations and machine-learning-powered assets for drug discovery used by a wide community of users.  
  right_title: Machine Intelligence
  right_text: Understanding and replicating human level intelligence in machines is of great importance for the progress of humanity. We look at realistic 3D simulated environments for navigation and robotic manipulation to develop learning methods which can be transferred to the real world. We are particularly interested in solving hard robotic challenges by training intelligent agents using super-scalable population learning methods using GPUGRID and low sample learning (arXiv:2007.03328) via imitation, self-imitation and model-based. Recently, we ranked second in the Unity obstacle tower challenge, an AI testbed for navigation, puzzle solving, etc. We currently own the SOTA on this challenge (arXiv:2007.02622).

    - link: HTMD
      url: https://www.htmd.org/
      text: is a Python platform for computational biology, including molecular simulations, docking, Markov state models, molecule manipulation, build tools for Amber and Charmm, visualization (webGL and VMD), adaptive sampling and more. Imagine setting up an entire computational experiment in a single, simple Python script.
    - link: ACEMD/OpenMM
      url: https://www.acellera.com/acemd
      text: has pioneered the use of GPUs for molecular simulations allowing for high-throughput simulations and ultimately leading to HTMD. ACEMD is still one of fastest molecular dynamics code and compatible with input files from Charmm and Amber. ACEMD is now based on OpenMM.
    - link: PyTorchRL
      url: https://github.com/PyTorchRL/pytorchrl
      text: is a scalable and modular reinforcement learning framework in PyTorch. Use it to write new algorithms and scale them up for real performance. This code currently hold the SOTA on Obstacle tower challenge by Unity3D.
