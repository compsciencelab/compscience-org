## Open Positions
### PhD position on Abstraction and reasoning challenge: Create an AI capable of solving reasoning tasks it has never seen before
[Universitat Pompeu Fabra](http://www.upf.edu/) and [Prof. Gianni De Fabritiis](https://es.linkedin.com/in/gdefabritiis), ICREA research professor, are looking to recruit a PhD student for a PhD on AI.

#### Description:

Can a computer learn complex, abstract tasks from just a few examples? Current machine learning techniques are data-hungry and brittle—they can only make sense of patterns they've seen before. Using current methods like reinforcement learning, an algorithm can gain new skills by exposure to large amounts of data, but cognitive abilities that could broadly generalize to many tasks remain elusive. This makes it very challenging to create systems that can handle the variability and unpredictability of the real world, such as domestic robots or self-driving cars. However, alternative approaches, like inductive programming, offer the potential for more human-like abstraction and reasoning.

The abstraction and reasoning corpus (ARC) provides a benchmark to measure AI skill-acquisition on unknown tasks, with the constraint that only a handful of demonstrations are shown to learn a complex task ([example](https://www.kaggle.com/c/abstraction-and-reasoning-challenge)). This competition was initially created by the creator of the Keras neural networks library and it’s explained in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.01547). The idea is to move beyond the competition timeframe to create an AI that can solve reasoning tasks it has never seen before and set up a path toward a PhD in AI. It is expected that novel work in terms of a paper should be produced during this period.

#### Location:

Barcelona, Spain, [Barcelona Biomedical Research park](http://www.prbb.org/). The laboratory is part of the Barcelona Biomedical Research Park which, with a privileged location on the shoreline of the Mediterranean sea, constitutes one of the most exciting interdisciplinary research centres in Southern Europe with more than 1000 scientists in the building alone.

One example of such activity was the Unity obstacle challenge, where a player had to navigate a 3D environment solving multiple intelligence related tasks like navigation, using keys, boxes, etc. In such instance, the lab reaches second place: See [this blog](https://blogs.unity3d.com/2019/08/07/announcing-the-obstacle-tower-challenge-winners-and-open-source-release/) and also [this one](https://blogs.unity3d.com/2019/11/29/accelerating-ml-research-meet-us-at-neurips-2019/).

The computational science laboratory, led by Gianni De Fabritiis has been successfully applying deep learning approaches on fundamental problems in these areas, such as protein-ligand docking, affinity prediction and protein folding, winning several international challenges. Currently, we are focused on developing intelligent agents that can outperform humans on specific problems.

### PhD Position in rational drug design of intrinsically disordered proteins
Academic supervisor:

Prof. Gianni De Fabritiis

Aims:

Coordination of cellular processes requires time-ordered formation of functional complexes for which the proper timing of binding and unbinding is critical. Although evidence exists for the relevance of kinetics for biological function, the underlying physical-chemistry mechanisms are still largely unexplored. This is especially true for protein domains without a native folded conformation as, in absence of a structured state, a shift of the equilibrium towards active or inactive states may not be feasible.

Using massively distributed molecular dynamics simulations, high performance codes and new Markov state analytical tools, all largely developed by us, we have shown in a series of pilot studies the capability to resolve molecular kinetics once the multi-millisecond timescale is reached. Preliminary mathematical kinetic models also show that, by modulating the molecular kinetics of competing on-pathway metastable states, it is possible to control the equilibrium of the complex, a novel and potentially important mechanism for intrinsically disordered proteins.

In this project, we aim to investigate the relevance and generality of molecular kinetics for intrinsically disordered protein domains and its modulation by small molecules. We will employ a computationally driven approach to resolve kinetics at atomic resolution, and will integrate our computational predictions with standard assays and experiments from collaborations with experimental experts and local facilities.

We expect the candidate to participate in the design and implementation of computational protocols to using the advanced computational developed in the group.
